# Business problem
The CFO of Rossmann Drug Stores requested a sales predction for each store for the next six weeks in order to define a budget for stores renovation. The current prediction was not satisfactory as there were several inconsistencies. In this context, I developed a machine learning model in order to provide more accurately forecast store sales.
# Business Assumptions
The days when stores were closed were removed from the analysis.
Only stores with sales values bigger than 0 were considered.
For stores that did not have Competition Distance information, it was assumed that the distance would be two times greater than the greatest distance from a nearest competitor.
